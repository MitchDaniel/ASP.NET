# Task 1
1. Create a new Web API project.
2. Remove the WeatherForecastController if it was generated by default.
3. In the Controllers folder, create a ProductsController based on ControllerBase.
4. Apply the [ApiController] attribute and the route pattern api/[controller].
5. Add two stub actions: GET /api/products and GET /api/products/{id}, both returning 200 OK.
6. Run the application and ensure that both routes return 200 OK.

# Task 2
1. Create a Models folder and a Product class with the fields: Id (int), Name (string), Price (decimal).
2. In ProductsController, prepare an in-memory product list (at least three records) with unique Id values and different field values.
3. Update the GET /api/products action so it returns the list.
4. Update GET /api/products/{id} so that if the record is not found, it returns 404 Not Found with the message Product not found.
5. Add a route constraint for {id} to be an integer.
6. Verify the responses and status codes 200 and 404.

# Task 3
1. Add a DTO for creating/updating a product (at least one required field: Name).
2. Implement POST /api/products (read the request body from the body):
- If the required field is missing or empty, return 400 Bad Request with an error message.
- If the creation succeeds, add a record to the collection, assign a new Id, and return 201 Created with a link to GET /api/products/{id}.
3. Implement PUT /api/products/{id}:
- If the product is not found — return 404 Not Found.
- If the request body is invalid — return 400 Bad Request.
- If successful — return 200 OK with the updated object.
4. Test the scenarios: successful POST, successful PUT, PUT on a non-existing id (expect 404).

# Task 4
1. Add DELETE /api/products/{id}:
- If the product is not found — return 404 Not Found.
- If deletion succeeds — return 204 No Content.
2. Add GET /api/products/search with a query parameter name (substring search, case-insensitive):
- If the name parameter is missing — return 400 Bad Request with a clear message.
- If present — return 200 OK and the list of results (empty list allowed).
3. Execute the following sequence in any HTTP client:
- Create a product (POST) → expect 201 Created and a new Id.
- Read by Id (GET/{id}) → 200 OK.
- Update (PUT/{id}) → 200 OK.
- Search by part of the name (GET/search?name=…) → 200 OK.
- Delete (DELETE/{id}) → 204 No Content.
- Read the same Id again → 404 Not Found.
