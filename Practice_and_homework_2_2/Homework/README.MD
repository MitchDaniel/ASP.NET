# Task 1
1. Create a new Web API project.
2. Remove the WeatherForecastController if it was generated by default.
3. In the Controllers folder, create an OrdersController based on ControllerBase.
4. Apply the [ApiController] attribute and the route pattern api/[controller].
5. Add two stub actions: GET /api/orders and GET /api/orders/{id} (at the first step — returning 200 OK).
6. Run the application and ensure that both routes return 200 OK.

# Task 2
1. Create a Models folder and an Order class with the fields: Id (int), Number (string), Total (decimal), CreatedAt (DateTime).
2. In OrdersController, prepare an in-memory order list (at least three records) with unique Id values and different field values.
3. Update the GET /api/orders action so it returns the list of orders.
4. Update GET /api/orders/{id} so that if the record is not found, it returns 404 Not Found with the text "Order not found".
5. Add a route constraint for the {id} parameter to be an integer.
6. Verify the responses and status codes 200 (existing id) and 404 (non-existent id).

# Task 3
1. Create a DTO for creating/updating an order (minimum required fields: Number, Total).
2. Implement POST /api/orders with reading the request body:
- If a required field is empty or missing — 400 Bad Request with a clear message.
- Upon successful creation, assign a new Id, add the record to the collection, and return 201 Created with a Location header pointing to GET /api/orders/{id}.
3. Implement PUT /api/orders/{id}:
- If the order is not found — 404 Not Found.
- If the input DTO contains invalid data — 400 Bad Request.
- If successful — 200 OK with the updated object.
4. Check the scenarios: successful POST, successful PUT, PUT on a non-existent id (expect 404).

# Task 4
1. Add DELETE /api/orders/{id}:
- If the order is not found — 404 Not Found.
- Upon successful deletion — 204 No Content.
2. Add GET /api/orders/search with query string parameters:
- Required number — case-insensitive substring search.
- Optional minTotal — filter by amount (decimal, inclusive boundary).
- If the required number is missing — 400 Bad Request with a clear message.
- If parameters are valid — 200 OK and a list of results (an empty list is allowed).
3. Execute a sequential scenario in any HTTP client:
- Create an order (POST) → expect 201 Created and a new Id.
- Read by Id (GET /{id}) → 200 OK.
- Update (PUT /{id}) → 200 OK.
- Search (GET /search?number=...&minTotal=...) → 200 OK.
- Delete (DELETE /{id}) → 204 No Content.
- Read the same Id again → 404 Not Found.
